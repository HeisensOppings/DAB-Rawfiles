# DAB-Rawfiles
rawfile for DAB Radio in-house testing

## RawFile
Since I can't get a DAB signal in my area. I gathered rawfiles from the internet to test the program.
[WorldDAB](https://www.worlddab.org/benefit/eti-library.pdf) There are a lot of rawfiles, but you need to be a member as a company to download them :(
